# OZVotingAdaptor allows malicious governors

## Summary
The contract `OZVotingAdaptor` allows arbitrary addresses to be governors and does not perform any validation check on the governance functions implementations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract does not validate whether the governor address is a valid implementation of the `IGovernor` interface. In other words, it blindly assumes that the governor contract conforms to the expected interface / implementation.

The attacker can use the logic within the governance functions (such as `propose`, `castVote`, ...) to perform malicious operations in the voting system.


## Impact
The exploitation of this issue can lead to double voting and other unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/adaptors/OZVotingAdaptor.sol#L27

```solidity
import {IGovernor} from '@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/IGovernor.sol';

contract OZVotingAdaptor is IVotingAdaptor, Ownable {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
    using Address for address payable;

    /// @notice The governor contract address.
    address public immutable governor;           // [x]

    /// @notice The voting token contract address.
    address public immutable votingToken;

    constructor(address _governor, address _votingToken, address _owner) {
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert INVALID_OWNER();
        if (_governor == address(0)) revert INVALID_GOVERNOR();
        if (_votingToken == address(0)) revert INVALID_VOTING_TOKEN();

        governor = _governor;             //[x]
       [...]
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Verify that the function signatures of IGorvernor matches with the ones from the governor address.

***Patch example***
```solidity
    /// @notice The governor contract address.
    address public immutable governor;

    /// @notice The voting token contract address.
    address public immutable votingToken;

    constructor(address _governor, address _votingToken, address _owner) {

        // Validate that the governor supports the IGovernor interface
        require(_supportsIGovernor(_governor), "Invalid governor contract");

        governor = _governor;
        // [...]
    }

    // Internal function to check if a contract supports the IGovernor interface
    function _supportsIGovernor(address _contract) internal view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 expectedHash = HashUtils.hashFunctionSignatures(
            IGovernor.castVote.selector, 
            IGovernor.castVoteWithReason.selector
            // Add more functions if needed
        );

        bytes32 actualHash = HashUtils.hashBytecode(_contract);

        return actualHash == expectedHash;
    }
