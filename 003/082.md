# Add min/max boundaries to vesting time

## Summary

The vesting time start and duration are not sanitised properly and can lead to misbehaves.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deployVestingContract` function from the `VestingEscrowFactory` does not perform enough checks on the input data. 

The `vestingStart` parameter should be at least equal to the block.timestamp to avoid creating an already passed vesting time. Or at least that `vestingStart` plus `vestingDuration` is bigger than the actual timestamp. If not is possible to create already passed vesting contracts from where users are able to retrieve tokens directly, which does not make sense for the usage of these contracts.

Also a max boundary can be considered to avoid creating a vesting for more time than expected. However this case is less important as revoke functions exist. 

## Impact

Creating an already passed vested time is inconsistent and can lead to token retrieval before than expected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding at least a minimum boundary check comparing against the current timestamp to ensure consistency and proper functionality.
