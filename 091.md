# Owner has excessive access to user funds

## Summary
As user must approve `VestingEscrowFactory` for token, `owner` can get access to any funds thus approved. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Steps: 
1) user approves `VestingEscrowFactory` for X tokens, where X often is uint256.max due to convenince or UX. 
2) owner then can frontrun user with `recoverERC20` before user calls `deployVestingContract`, or maliciously or erroneously move funds after. 
## Impact
HIGH - user funds at risk.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make `recoverERC20` allow to move funds only if `token_` != token (not the token set up in constructor)
