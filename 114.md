# Missing validation if votingToken in OZVotingAdaptor is the same as the token specified by VestingEscrowFactory

## Summary
When updating a new voting adaptor, factory owner may choose an OZVotingAdaptor  with a different token from the token defined originally in VestingEscrowFactory

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check if the token from these 2 contracts are the same

## Impact
User's voting power can be larger than usual if token from VestingEscrowFactory has less value on market than the token in OZVotingAdaptor
