# Risk of vampire attack on the protocol.

## Summary
A malicious user can execute a [vampire attack](https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/) on the protocol. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can create a vesting escrow, without any restrictions. 

A malicious user (using a smart contract) can create an escrow for vesting, and encourage more users to vest their tokens not directly with the protocol but through him. He does this by introducing incentives bigger incentives. The contract can later be sold for financial gain. 

He can also use this to gain more voting power, as more users vest through him, he gains more influence over the voting process and can manipulate voting outcomes to his favour.

Important to note that this works best if the escrow is irrevocable and even if revocable, the existing voting power can still do damage. 
## Impact
User diverts investments away from the protocol, and can gain significant power over the voting process.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
A block function can be introduced for cases like this. The function should revoke escrow regardless of if it's revokable or not, at the same time should prevent such user from voting.
