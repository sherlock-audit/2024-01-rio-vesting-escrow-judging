# Users can steal voting power from the initial delegatee

## Summary

Users can steal voting power from the initial delegatee


## Vulnerability Detail

The contracts allow the factory owner to assign an initial delagatee, who is supposed to hold the voting power until it is changed. The contracts also allow an owner to specify that vesting must start in the future, rather than immediately. Note that the initial delagatee isn't the recipient of the escrow, but is some address that will be set for all escrows created by that factory, i.e. an organization. Consider the case of a large organization that wishes to maintain voting power, while the set up all of their escrows over a period of weeks. The organization would set the start date for each escrow to be in the future, and set itself to be the initial delegatee. 


## Impact

An organization, such as the one described above, would be vulnerable to having its voting power taken immediately as each escrow is created, since voting/delegation by the escrow recipient is not gated by the escrow's start time. Consider the case of one company buying another, and the acquirer is attempting to use the escrows to distribute shares to the employees of the other company on the close date of the acquisition. Users would be able to pool their voting power prior to the close of the transaction, and would be able to potentially disrupt the transaction.


## Code Snippet

Voting an delegation does not check the current time against the [`startTime`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L34)
```solidity
// File: src/VestingEscrow.sol : VestingEscrow.vote()   #1

152        /// @notice Participate in a governance vote using all available tokens on the contract's balance.
153        /// @param params The ABI-encoded data for call. Can be obtained from VotingAdaptor.encodeVoteCalldata.
154        function vote(bytes calldata params) external onlyRecipient whenVotingAdaptorIsSet returns (bytes memory) {
155            return _votingAdaptor().functionDelegateCall(abi.encodeCall(IVotingAdaptor.vote, (params)));
156:       }
```

56        /// @param params The ABI-encoded delegatee address.
57        function delegate(bytes calldata params) external {
58            IVotes(votingToken).delegate(abi.decode(params, (address)));
59:       }

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Don't allow voting or delegation until after the `startTime()`
