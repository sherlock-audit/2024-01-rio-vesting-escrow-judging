# Ensuring Distinct Roles Owner and Manager Addresses Should Not Be the Same, as it could lead to confusion or unintended consequences.

## Summary
The code does not explicitly check whether the manager and owner addresses are the same in `VestingEscrowFactory.sol:Constructor()`.
There's a potential vulnerability if the manager and owner addresses are allowed to be the same, as it could lead to confusion or unintended **consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the manager and owner addresses are allowed to be the same, it may lead to potential security risks or operational issues.Having the manager and owner as distinct entities is a common security practice to separate responsibilities and prevent unauthorized actions.


## Impact

Having the similar owner and manager could risk some of the operations of the vestingEscrow contract, as owner have more rights and more load of operations compare to manager like `VestingEscrow.sol:revokeAll()`, `VestingEscrow.sol:revokeUnvested()` and `VestingEscrow.sol:permanentlyDisableFullRevocation()` are sensitive functions which can significantly impact the functioning of the vestingEscrow contract. By having same address as owner he manager can control these functions.
So if manager turns out he can harm the protocol and can have unintended consequences.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L30
```javascript
constructor(address _vestingEscrowImpl, address _token, address _owner, address _manager, address _votingAdaptor) {
        if (_vestingEscrowImpl == address(0)) revert INVALID_VESTING_ESCROW_IMPL();
        if (_token == address(0)) revert INVALID_TOKEN();
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert INVALID_OWNER();

        vestingEscrowImpl = _vestingEscrowImpl;
        token = _token;
        manager = _manager;
        votingAdaptor = _votingAdaptor;

        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure Manager and Owner Addresses are Distinct, Implement a check to ensure that the manager and owner addresses are not the same. This helps maintain a clear separation of roles and reduces the risk of unauthorized actions.

```diff
constructor(address _vestingEscrowImpl, address _token, address _owner, address _manager, address _votingAdaptor) {
        if (_vestingEscrowImpl == address(0)) revert INVALID_VESTING_ESCROW_IMPL();
        if (_token == address(0)) revert INVALID_TOKEN();
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert INVALID_OWNER();
+       require(_owner != _manager,"Revert Reason: owner and manager having similar addresses");
        vestingEscrowImpl = _vestingEscrowImpl;
        token = _token;
        manager = _manager;
        votingAdaptor = _votingAdaptor;

        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }
```
