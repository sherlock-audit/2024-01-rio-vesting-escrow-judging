# Unchecked External Token Transfer

## Summary

The VestingEscrow contract contains a critical vulnerability in the `claim` function. In this function, the `safeTransfer` method is used to transfer tokens to a specified beneficiary. However, the code neglects to verify the return value of this external call. In the event of a failed token transfer (due to various reasons such as insufficient gas or a faulty recipient contract), the contract's state becomes inconsistent, potentially leading to a loss of funds. To mitigate this risk, it is imperative to include an explicit check for the return value of the `safeTransfer` function and handle any potential failures, ensuring the contract's security and preventing possible financial losses. Immediate attention and remediation are advised.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `claim` function utilizes the `safeTransfer` function from the SafeERC20 library to transfer tokens to the specified `beneficiary`. However, this function does not check the return value of the external call, and in the case of a failed token transfer, the contract's state may be left inconsistent, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

## Impact
The unchecked external token transfer vulnerability in the `claim` function of the VestingEscrow contract poses a significant risk. If a token transfer fails for any reason, the contract's state may become inconsistent, potentially leading to a loss of funds. The impact could range from financial losses for users attempting to claim tokens to a potential denial of service attack on the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement explicit checks for the return value of the `safeTransfer` function in the `claim` method to prevent potential token transfer failures and ensure the contract's state remains consistent.
