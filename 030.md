# User can get instant access to `vesting token` without actually waiting for the vesting period to conclude

## Summary

User can get instant access to `vesting token` without actually waiting for the vesting period to conclude by using a 2 point address token, since there are no limitations on the token used.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever a `VestingEscrow` is created by `VestingEscrowFactory`:

```solidity
function deployVestingContract(
        uint256 amount,
        address recipient,
        uint40 vestingDuration,
        uint40 vestingStart,
        uint40 cliffLength,
        bool isFullyRevokable,
        bytes calldata initialDelegateParams
    ) external returns (address escrow) {
        if (vestingDuration == 0) revert INVALID_VESTING_DURATION();
        if (cliffLength > vestingDuration) revert INVALID_VESTING_CLIFF();
        if (recipient == address(0)) revert INVALID_RECIPIENT();
        if (amount == 0) revert INVALID_AMOUNT();

        escrow = vestingEscrowImpl.clone(
            abi.encodePacked(
                address(this), token, recipient, vestingStart, vestingStart + vestingDuration, cliffLength, amount
            )
        );

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, escrow, amount);
        IVestingEscrow(escrow).initialize(isFullyRevokable, initialDelegateParams);

        emit VestingEscrowCreated(msg.sender, recipient, escrow);
    }

```
    
There is no limit on what tokens to be used, so if an `escrow` with a token which has 2 point address is created, the recipient of the `escrow` can immediately claim the `vesting token` without waiting for the period to conclude, rendering the contract useless.
    

In `VestingEscrow` there is `recoverERC20`, which is used to rescue accidentally sent tokens to the contract:

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;

        if (token_ == address(token())) {

            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);

        }

        if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }
```
    
The function makes sure that the input `address token_` is not the same as the currently `vesting token`:

```solidity
if (token_ == address(token())) {

            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);

        }
```

If a 2 point address token is used a recipient can easily skip this check by using the `secondary address` of the `vesting token` which is set with it's `primary address` in the contract and it will go straight to transferring the token: 

```solidity
if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }

```

## Impact

Escrow recipient can get full amount of `vesting token` instantaneously.
