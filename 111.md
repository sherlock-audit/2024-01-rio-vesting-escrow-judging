# Fee-on-transfer tokens aren't supported

## Summary

Fee-on-transfer tokens aren't supported by the current escrow implementation

## Vulnerability Detail
In `VestingEscrowFactory.sol` the amount varaible is used to transfer the tokens to address where Escrow contract is deployed.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L65
```javascript
escrow = vestingEscrowImpl.clone(
  abi.encodePacked(
    address(this),
    token,
    recipient,
    vestingStart,
    vestingStart + vestingDuration,
    cliffLength,
    amount
  )
);
```

but the actual token transfer to the Escrow will be less than the Amount which they are keeping track of , `VestingEScorw:totalLocked()` it represent the amount of tokens locked inside the contract which was assigned the value of amount in `vestingEScorwFactory.sol` at the time of deployement.
This will cause the call to create a new instance of Escrow trigger the following revert in `VestingEscrow:intialize()`.

```javascript
  if (_token.balanceOf(address(this)) < _totalLocked) revert INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE();
```

suppose totalLocked value is 5000, but actual token value locked inside is 4900 this if statment cause revert because totalLocked balance will be always greater.

## Impact

The protocol prevents the use of fee-on-transfer tokens without explicitly defining these conditions. The inability to do so doesn't require malicious action by either party and given the sponsor comment with regard to compatible tokens this doesn't appear to be addressed:

But, the organization could do whatever they want - just we would recommend against that."

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L92
```javascript
 function initialize(bool _isFullyRevokable, bytes calldata _initialDelegateParams) external {
        address _factory = address(factory());
        uint256 _totalLocked = totalLocked();
        uint40 _endTime = endTime();
        IERC20 _token = token();


        if (msg.sender != _factory) revert NOT_FACTORY(msg.sender);
        // @audit because totalLocked is set by amount value , which is not real value which will be present in contract after transfer
        if (_token.balanceOf(address(this)) < _totalLocked) revert INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE();
        disabledAt = _endTime;
        isFullyRevokable = _isFullyRevokable;
        if (_initialDelegateParams.length != 0) _delegate(_initialDelegateParams);

        emit VestingEscrowInitialized(
            _factory,
            recipient(),
            address(_token),
            _totalLocked,
            startTime(),
            _endTime,
            cliffLength(),
            _isFullyRevokable
        );
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the value passed to totalLocked while deploying VestingEscrowFactory from amount to the actual amount to tokens transferred to the Escrow, this is just a thought their may be some other ways.
