# Initialize Incorrect Access Control

## Summary
Initialize can be called by all not just the factory contract due to lack of CEI in initialize() function. This leads to several other vulnerabilities detailed below.

## Vulnerability Detail
initialize() is intended to be called only by VestingEscrowFactory and is done so in the deployVestingContract. However in VestingEscrow.sol, initialize() is an external function with no access control.
initialize() is supposed to be protected by the if statement (msg.sender != factory) but this can be bypassed by supplying msg.sender as factor in _initialDelegateParams. This is because _factory is set by initialize before the if statement is evaluated. As a result you can initialize multiple times and modify the various parameters to create vulnerabilities and elicit unexpected behavior

## Impact
As a result of calling initialize() you can: End vesting early and claim early, by setting lockedTime to 0. Change revokable status.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow CEI, Implement Access Modifier for initialize().
