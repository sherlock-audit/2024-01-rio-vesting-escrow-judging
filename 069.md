# Owner should not renounce itself

## Summary
The `VestingEscrowFactory` contract depends on the `owner` to for many things, including `updatingValidator`, `changeManager` etc. More importantly, recovered funds are transferred to the `owner` address as seen here: 
1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L209
2. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L218
3. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L82
4. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L91

Therefore, it is imperative that the owner address at no point is reset to 0 or renounced. 

Now, the `VestingEscrowFactory` contract inherits from `Ownable2Step` contract as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L13 which allows the owner to renounce itself. 
I have provided the below PoC showing the `owner` renouncing ownership and setting it to `address(0)`. 

With the vitality of the `owner()` address, it is a huge security risk that can lead to loss of funds if it is renounced. 
## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in this PoC code that can be added to the `VestingEscrowFactory` contract
```Solidity
    function testRenounceOwner() public {
        vm.startPrank(address(factory.owner()));
        console.logAddress(factory.owner());
        factory.renounceOwnership();
        console.logAddress(factory.owner());
    }
```
It is possible to renounce ownership.
## Impact
Funds recovery would be impossible leading to Permanently stuck funds

## Recommendation
Consider overriding the `Ownable2Step` renounce function and make the call revert.
