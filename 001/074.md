# Recoverable funds functions send the value to `recipient`

## Summary
`VestingEscrow.recoverERC20` and `VestingEscrow.recoverEther` send the funds to `recipient` address instead of factory owner which is trusted. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`recoverEther` and `recoverERC20` allow anyone to recover any stucked funds and their transfer to `recipient` address. 
But recipient is not trusted and he can refuse forward the funds to their rightful owner. 

## Impact
Any funds sent by mistake to `escrow` contracts,  can be lost.

```solidity
    function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;
        if (token_ == address(token())) {
            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
        }
        if (recoverable > 0) {
@>          IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }

        if (amount > 0) {

            emit ETHRecovered(amount);
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recover funds to factory owner or factory manager. These are considered trusted entities and should forward recovered funds to their rightful owner.
