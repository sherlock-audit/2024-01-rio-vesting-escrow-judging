# revokeAll() can be frontrun resulting on recovering less tokens than expected

## Summary

The `VestingEscrow.revokeAll()` function can be frontrun by the `recipient` resulting in recovering less tokens than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Considering the context wherin an `owner` would call `revokeAll()`, a malisius `recipient` can easily frontrun the tx and call `VestingEscrow.call()`, bypassing the `if (isFullyRevoked) return 0;` validation in [L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L120C9-L120C38). And by doing so, they'd transfer to themselves any `unclaimed` token before `revokeAll()` is executed.

## Impact

The `owner` will only get transfered back the `locked` tokens and not the `locked + unclaimed` ones, as intended by them when submitting the transaction.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol should look for alternatives when looking to revoke unclaimed tokens. Otherwise, it'd be recommended to clearly state this risk in the documentation.
