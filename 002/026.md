# Lack of Reentrancy Protection in the revokeAll Function

## Summary
The revokeAll function in the VestingEscrow contract lacks proper protection against reentrancy attacks, posing a potential security risk to the contract.


## Vulnerability Detail
The revokeAll function within the VestingEscrow contract lacks a robust reentrancy protection mechanism, exposing the contract to potential vulnerabilities associated with reentrant attacks. In Ethereum smart contracts, reentrancy attacks occur when external contracts maliciously exploit the reentrant nature of contract execution, allowing them to make recursive calls to functions within the same context. In the case of the VestingEscrow contract, the absence of a proper reentrancy guard in the revokeAll function opens up the possibility for attackers to manipulate the contract state and potentially compromise its security.

In-depth Analysis
The vulnerable revokeAll function exhibits the following characteristics:

```solidity
function revokeAll() external onlyOwner {
    if (!isFullyRevokable) revert NOT_FULLY_REVOKABLE();
    if (isFullyRevoked) revert ALREADY_FULLY_REVOKED();

    uint256 revokable = locked() + unclaimed();
    if (revokable == 0) revert NOTHING_TO_REVOKE();

    isFullyRevoked = true;
    disabledAt = uint40(block.timestamp);

    token().safeTransfer(_owner(), revokable);
    emit VestingFullyRevoked(msg.sender, revokable);
}
```

**Potential Exploitation Scenario**
An attacker initiates a reentrancy attack by calling the revokeAll function recursively within the same execution context.
During each recursive call, the attacker gains control over the contract's state and initiates additional transactions.
The attacker may manipulate the flow of execution, leading to unintended consequences such as incorrect fund transfers or locking up the contract.
## Impact
The lack of reentrancy protection in the revokeAll function poses significant risks, including but not limited to:

**Fund Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to manipulate fund transfers, leading to potential financial losses or unintended fund movements.

**State Manipulation:** The absence of reentrancy protection allows an attacker to interfere with the contract's state, potentially compromising the integrity of the VestingEscrow system.

**Denial of Service:** In extreme cases, a successful reentrancy attack could lead to the temporary or permanent denial of service, rendering the contract unresponsive.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the identified vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to implement a robust reentrancy protection mechanism in the revokeAll function. A common approach is to use a reentrancy guard modifier, as demonstrated in the following example:

```solidity
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(!_locked, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _locked = true;
    _;
    _locked = false;
}
```
Apply this modifier to the revokeAll function to ensure that it can only be executed once at a time, preventing reentrancy vulnerabilities
