# Owner can maliciously revoke the unclaimed tokens even after the vesting duration  has been ended .

## Summary
Revoking functionality is for revoking the vesting funds when inside the vesting duration  . But it is not ensured in the `revokeAll` function . That's why unclaimed tokens can be still revoked after a successful vesting . Which is not  acceptable for the recipient . 

A malicious owner can take this advantage and revoke the unclaimed tokens even after the vesting duration  has been ended and there's no locked funds . 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `revokeAll` function in the exccrow contract : 
```solidity 
   function revokeAll() external onlyOwner {
        if (!isFullyRevokable) revert NOT_FULLY_REVOKABLE();
        if (isFullyRevoked) revert ALREADY_FULLY_REVOKED();

        uint256 revokable = locked() + unclaimed();
        if (revokable == 0) revert NOTHING_TO_REVOKE();

        isFullyRevoked = true;
        disabledAt = uint40(block.timestamp);

        token().safeTransfer(_owner(), revokable);
        emit VestingFullyRevoked(msg.sender, revokable);
    }
```
The main issue here is there's no functionality to check if the vesting has ended or not . If the vesting duration has been ended and some unclaimed tokens are left in the contract for late claiming , vesting could be still revoked by the owner and unclaimed tokens will be sent to the owner . Which is unacceptable for the recipient as the vesting is succesfully finished . 

## Impact
Owner can maliciously revoke the unclaimed tokens even after the vesting duration  has been ended .

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check for ensuring that vesting is still going on : 
```diff 
  function revokeAll() external onlyOwner {
        if (!isFullyRevokable) revert NOT_FULLY_REVOKABLE();
        if (isFullyRevoked) revert ALREADY_FULLY_REVOKED();
+       if (block.timestamp > disabledAt ) revert () ; // Add custiom error defining reason .

```
