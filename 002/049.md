# VestingEscrow.revokeAll function can be frontrunned

## Summary
Recipient can frontrun `revokeAll` function to claim unclaimed tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
VestingEscrow.revokeAll function allows owner to stop vesting for the recipient and [transfer unclaimed and locked tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L181). So in case if user didn't claim before and his unclaimed balance is not 0, then he will lose that amount.

Thus it is likely that any recipient will frontrun `VestingEscrow.revokeAll` function with `claim` call in order to decrease loss.
## Impact
Recipient can decrease his loss and claim unclaimed tokens before they are transferred to owner.
