# Malicious attacker able to front run revoke functions and transfer tokens before it happens

## Summary
The `VestingEscrow` serves as a vesting contract designated for a sole beneficiary, enabling users to claim vested tokens. The administrator holds authority to revoke both unvested and unclaimed rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
By monitoring transactions in the mempool, users can observe the execution of `VestingEscrow::revokeUnvested()` or `VestingEscrow::revokeAll()`. Frontrunners have the potential to transfer all funds prior to the completion of these functions. The affected functions include `VestingEscrow::claim()`, `VestingEscrow::recoverERC20()`, and `VestingEscrow::recoverEther()`.

## Impact
Frontrunning poses a risk of the protocol losing both ether and tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Enfore the [Delay Mechanism](https://github.com/telcoin/telcoin-staking/pull/21/files). TL;DR Allow user to request and Admin may approve funds to be transfered.
2) Use private mem pools in place to submit `revokeAll()` & `revokeUnvested()` privately
