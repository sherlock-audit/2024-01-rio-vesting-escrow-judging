# Calls to `revokeAll()` in `VestingEscrow.sol` can be frontrun

## Summary
Recipients can frontrun calls to `revokeAll()` with a call to `claim()`, claiming tokens they should not be able to receive.

## Vulnerability Detail 
The `revokeAll()` function in `VestingEscrow.sol` can be called (by the `owner`) to revoke all tokens from the recipient, including already vested tokens that could be withdrawn. 

A sophisticated recipient could monitor the mempool for calls to `revokeAll()` and frontrun the transactions by calling the function `claim()` before the call to `revokeAll()` is executed.

## Impact
Recipients are able to retrieve tokens they should not be able to get, since a call to `revokeAll()` implies all tokens, including currently vested ones, should be revoked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Other protocols solved this issue by implementing a withdrawal queue. Meaning the `recipient` signals his intention to withdraw the vested tokens and only after a pre-deteremined amount of time (ex. 3 days) they are able to transfer the vested tokens.
