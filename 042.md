# Recipient can’t claim vested tokens due to precision loss.

## Summary
Recipient will get 0 vested token amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let assume totallocked amount = 1000e18, vestingduration = 365days, clifflength = 90days.
2. So now 185days have passed and recipient should claim = 1000e18*(185/365) = 1000e18*0.506 = 506e18 token amounts.
3. But the recipient can’t claim this because in solidity when dividing if numerator is less than denominator then division is 0.
4. So when recipient call the claim function to get vested amount, recipient will get = 1000e18*(185/365) = 1000e18*0 = 0 tokens amount

## Impact
Recipient will get 0 vested token amounts.

## Recommendation
Make sure that precision loss can’t occurs when calculating the vested amounts.
