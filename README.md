# Issue H-1: Vaults can be bricked by `selfdestruct()`ing implementations, using forged immutable args

## Summary

The clone-with-immutable-args pattern is unsafe to use when one of the immutable arguments controls an address being delegated to.


## Vulnerability Detail

As was seen in the Astaria beacon proxy [issue](https://x.com/apoorvlathey/status/1671308196743647232?s=20), an attacker is able to forge the calldata that the proxy normally would forward, and can cause the implementation to `selfdestruct()` itself via a `delegatecall()`. The current code has a very similar vulnerability, in that every escrow performs a `delegatecall()` to an address coming from the factory, which is a forgeable immutable argument.


## Impact

By creating a fake `IVotingAdaptor`, and providing properly-formatted calldata to the implementation contract being passed to each factory, an attacker can gain control via the `delegatecall()` in order to `selfdestruct()` each of the factories' implementations, preventing each factory's escrows from functioning further, including the withdrawal of tokens by any party.


## Code Snippet

The `factory()` function gets its value from an immutable argument:
```solidity
// File: src/VestingEscrow.sol : VestingEscrow.factory()   #1

18        /// @notice The factory that created this VestingEscrow instance.
19        function factory() public pure returns (IVestingEscrowFactory) {
20            return IVestingEscrowFactory(_getArgAddress(0));
21:       }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L18-L21

whose subsequent [responses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L234-L236) end up being used with `delegatecall()`s:
```solidity
// File: src/VestingEscrow.sol : VestingEscrow.vote()   #2

152        /// @notice Participate in a governance vote using all available tokens on the contract's balance.
153        /// @param params The ABI-encoded data for call. Can be obtained from VotingAdaptor.encodeVoteCalldata.
154        function vote(bytes calldata params) external onlyRecipient whenVotingAdaptorIsSet returns (bytes memory) {
155            return _votingAdaptor().functionDelegateCall(abi.encodeCall(IVotingAdaptor.vote, (params)));
156:       }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L152-L156

```solidity
// File: src/adaptors/OZVotingAdaptor.sol : OZVotingAdaptor.delegate()   #3

55        /// @notice Delegate votes.
56        /// @param params The ABI-encoded delegatee address.
57        function delegate(bytes calldata params) external {
58            IVotes(votingToken).delegate(abi.decode(params, (address)));
59:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Use a state/contract variable for anything requiring being delegated to.


## PoC

Because of a [foundry bug](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/1543) the test is not able to show the end result of the `selfdestruct()`, so I've added a print statement

**solimander**

I believe this is valid. Forging of calldata variables will allow anyone to bypass protections and `selfdestruct` the implementation contract.

Not sure if I'm jumping the gun here, but fixed in https://github.com/rio-org/rio-vesting-escrow/pull/6

Isn't this issue ONLY applicable to beacon proxy or ERC1967 proxy contracts? 

The contracts are using clones(ERC-1167: Minimal Proxy Contract) and [per openzeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable-onlyProxy--),

> onlyProxy()
Check that the execution is being performed through a delegatecall call and that the execution context is a proxy contract with an implementation (as defined in ERC1967) pointing to self. This should only be the case for UUPS and transparent proxies that are using the current contract as their implementation. Execution of a function through ERC1167 minimal proxies (clones) would not normally pass this test, but is not guaranteed to fail.

code reference take from [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol)
```solidity

    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable
    address private immutable __self = address(this);



    /**
     * @dev Check that the execution is being performed through a delegatecall call and that the execution context is
     * a proxy contract with an implementation (as defined in ERC-1967) pointing to self. This should only be the case

     */
    modifier onlyProxy() {
        _checkProxy();
        _;
    }


    /**
     * @dev Reverts if the execution is not performed via delegatecall or the execution
     * context is not of a proxy with an ERC-1967 compliant implementation pointing to self.
     * See {_onlyProxy}.
     */
    function _checkProxy() internal view virtual {
        if (
            address(this) == __self || // Must be called through delegatecall
            ERC1967Utils.getImplementation() != __self // Must be called through an active proxy
        ) {
            revert UUPSUnauthorizedCallContext();
        }
    }
```

similar modifier has been used by project team [here](https://github.com/rio-org/rio-vesting-escrow/pull/6/commits/9932073d6c0b4bfcc72961b647dd66a72b931ea5#diff-bad9934dc79f93bce7e10124cce6096927b8207510a9eff058f3217f10832803R19) as seen in pull request.


Can you please check the issue is really with minimal proxies? if its possible, Not sure why the user i.e recipient will do this to stuck his own tokens since the functions are onlyRecipient protected? If it can be done by malicious owner then owner is trusted here? Or am i missing something or the context of above openzeppelin reference is misunderstood?

Thanks and appreciate the response.

**detectiveking123**

I believe this is a valid issue as well. It is a good catch.

You're misunderstanding somewhat. The problem is related to the fact that the "immutable" variables are actually calldata, and can therefore be forged when when calling the implementation contract directly. First, the attacker needs to bypass `onlyRecipient`, which they can do by setting the recipient (`_getArgAddress(40)`) to their address in the calldata. Then they call one of the three functions that delegate-calls `_votingAdaptor` (`delegate`, `vote`, or `voteWithReason`). `_votingAdaptor` can be faked via a forged `factory`. The fake `_votingAdaptor` then calls self-destruct and there goes the implementation contract. All escrows are bricked.

**IllIllI000**

The [PR](https://github.com/rio-org/rio-vesting-escrow/pull/6) properly mitigates the issue by creating and using a new `onlyDelegateCall` modifier (similar to OZ's [version](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades/blob/2cf601497f7ff5bb9554d056e0b17725dbe64e7e/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/faq.adoc#can-i-safely-use-delegatecall-and-selfdestruct)) on the external `vote()` and `voteWithReason()` functions, as well as on the internal `_delegate()` function, which are the only functions making `delegatecall()`s from implementations, on results controlled by a `_getArgAddress()` internal function call. The new modifier is added to a new mixin which adds a new `immutable` `address` contract variable and sets it to the contract's own address during construction. The mixin is added to the vulnerable `VestingEscrow` contract's inheritance chain, and properly rejects any call coming from the contract by checking `address(this)` against the stored address, which correctly won't match for `delegatecall`s. The PR also adds the `delegate()`, `vote()`, and `voteWithReason()` functions from `VestingEscrow.sol` to `IVestingEscrow.sol`, and adds passing negative tests for the attack on each of those functions on the factory's implementation. There is no test for an attack on `initialize()`. The PR also updates the gas snapshot numbers. The clone itself (proxy) is not vulnerable, because it forwards all requests via `delegatecall()`, rather than relying on any of the implementation's code.

Thanks @IllIllI000! I've added a test for an attack on initialize: https://github.com/rio-org/rio-vesting-escrow/pull/6/commits/a6544b174aff9b2ff766f7aece03b052ec2b7466
