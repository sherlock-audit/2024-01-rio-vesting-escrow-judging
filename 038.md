# Unchecked Return Value in Low-Level Calls


## Summary

Unchecked return value from low level call 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function recoverEther()  on VestingEscrowFactory, VestingEscrow and OZVotingAdaptor contains two issues one that is not-valid via sherlock [rule](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging#vii.-list-of-issue-categories-that-are-not-considered-valid)  which is the usage of sendValue instead of call due to gas but the other one is that this function doesnt check the return value of the low-level call, so if the call fails, the whole transaction wont revert. 

I assume that the project instead of using sendValue he uses the other way which is call but this call will return a boolean value indicating whether the call was successful. However, it is important to note that this return value is not being checked in the current implementation.


## Impact
There is a possibility that the call wasn't successful, while the transaction continues without reverting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to ensure that the return value of the low-level call is checked. If the call is unsuccessful, the protocol should revert the entire transaction. The suggested modification is as follows:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(recipient()).call{value: amount}("");
require(success,"Low level call failed");
```
