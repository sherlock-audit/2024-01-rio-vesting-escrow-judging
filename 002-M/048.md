# Governor.castVoteWithReasonAndParams function is not available

## Summary
Because it's not possible to call Governor.castVoteWithReasonAndParams function from VestingEscrow contract, then in case if voting module uses params to calculate votes, then recipient will not be able to vote.
## Vulnerability Detail
VestingEscrow contract provides ability to delegate votes and cast votes [through OZVotingAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L148-L163) using delegatecall.

IGovernor interface has `castVoteWithReasonAndParams` function, that [is not implemented by OZVotingAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/adaptors/OZVotingAdaptor.sol#L42-L66).

In case if DAO will have implementation that only uses such function for voting(all other will be disabled) to [fetch user votes according to `params`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L247), then `recipient` will not be able to vote from the contract and will have only option to delegate.
## Impact
Recipient can't vote when `castVoteWithReasonAndParams` function is used for voting.
