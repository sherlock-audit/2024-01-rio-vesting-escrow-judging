# Timing attacks on address comparison

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the third line of `recoverERC20()`, we find this check ` if (token_ == address(token()))` which compares addresses directly, this behavior may open doors to timing attacks.

In this scenario, if an attacker is aware that the `token_` address matches the token() address, they might try to exploit the fact that the execution time of the comparison operation can vary depending on whether the addresses are equal or not.

Timing Attack Scenario:
1.    (Addresses Match): If the comparison is true, the execution time might be slightly longer.
2.    (Addresses Don't Match): If the comparison is false, the execution time is shorter.

## Impact
An attacker, by measuring the execution time of the function, could potentially get information about the addresses, such as whether they are equal or not. This information leakage can be used maliciously to gain an advantage in subsequent attacks.

```solidity
 function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;
        if (token_ == address(token())) {        // [here]

            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
        }
        if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate timing attacks in such cases, it is recommended to avoid direct address comparisons. Instead, consider using operations that have consistent execution times, such as checking the balance of the token using `IERC20(token_).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0`. This ensures that the timing of the operation remains consistent regardless of whether the addresses match or not.
