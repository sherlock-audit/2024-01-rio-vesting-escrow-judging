# Recipient can claim all the tokens immediately after the cliff window, ahead of the vesting schedule.

## Summary
Recipient can bypass tracking of claimed tokens by calling recoverERC20() function instead of claim function and avoid updating the totalClaimed tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
When Recipient calls recoverERC20() function on VestingEscrow, the totalClaimed state variable is not being updated.
This allows the recipient to claim the tokens using recoverERC20() and exposes to a scenario where Recipient can claim tokens ahead of schedule.

Scenario:
Token: USDC
Amount: 10000
EndTime: 120 days
Cliff:90 days

After 90 days, lets say, 91st day Recipient claims 7583 tokens.
Immediately after that, user can pass 2417 as the amount in the recoverERC20() function.
Since the totalClaimed amount was not update, the Recipient could claim the 2417 tokens as well on the 91st day taking out all the due amount from the vesting Contract with out waiting per the schedule.

```Solidity
 function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
```

## Impact
Recipient can claim tokens ahead of the vesting schedule.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L202-L212

Since the totalClaimed state variable is not being updated, the Recipient can claim all the tokens immediately after the cliff window
using multiple calls and drain the balance of the vesting contract ahead of schedule.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update totalClaimed state variable while claiming tokens via recoverERC20() as below.

```solidity
  if (token_ == address(token())) {
            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
            totalClaimed += recoverable;
        }
```
