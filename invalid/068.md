# The VestingEscrow can be reinitialized over and over again

## Summary
Upon deployment of the `VestingEscrow` contract from the factory, the `VestingEscrow` contract is initialized with its parameters as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L72

After initialization, it is not expected the `VestingEscrow` contract to be re-initialized again even by the `factory` contract. In fact, according to the contest, here is the quoted detailed explanation of additional protocol roles 
```Solidity
Are there any additional protocol roles? If yes, please explain in detail:

Factory Owner: This role can update the manager, update the voting adaptor, revoke unvested tokens, revoke all tokens (if enabled), and disable full revocation (if enabled).
```
Clearly, no one including the Factory contract should `reinitialize` the `VestingEscrow` contract after deployment. 

The `VestingContract` `initialize` function does not ascertain that re-initialization` is not possible as seen in my PoC code below. This allows the contract to be initialized more than once so long as it has enough token balance. But, it is expected that the contract can have more funds than the `totalLocked ()` amount because we in the `initialize` function the check is `if (_token.balanceOf(address(this)) < _totalLocked) revert INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE(); //@audit contract can be re-initialized ` and also presence of  functions such as `recoverERC20` or making re-initialization possible. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the `VestingEscrow` initialize function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L92-L118. 

Here is the PoC code that can be added to the  test-case `VestingEscrow.t.sol` as evidence of contract re-initialization.
```Solidity
    function testreInitializeFromFactory() public {
        vm.startPrank(address(factory));
    
        deployedVesting.initialize(true, new bytes(0));
        deployedVesting.initialize(true, new bytes(0));
        deployedVesting.initialize(true, new bytes(0));
        deployedVesting.initialize(true, new bytes(0));
        console.log(deployedVesting.totalLocked());
    }
```


## Impact
The contract can be initialized more than once

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check in the `initialize function preventing contract re-initialization
