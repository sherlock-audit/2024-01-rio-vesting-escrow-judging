# Reentrancy in `recoverERC20` allows drainage of all funds, even locked ones

## Summary

There is a reentrancy vulnerability in `recoverERC20` for tokens that implement a `_beforeTokenTransfer` method, and could potentially give control back to the attacker. 

## Vulnerability Detail

recoverERC20 looks something like this:

```solidity
    function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;
        if (token_ == address(token())) {
            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) -
                (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
        }
        if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }
```

Notice that we first calculate the available amount and then send it to the recipient. If the token implements a `_beforeTokenTransfer` method that somehow gives control over to the attacker, then the attacker can re-enter `recoverERC20` and again claim the same amount over and over again, draining the contract despite potentially not having vested the funds. 

## Impact

Drainage of funds in the contract
