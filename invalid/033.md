# VotingEscrow::claim() is not working as expected

## Summary
The `claim()` of `VotingEscrow.sol` contract is not working as expected, due to such behaviour user who have vested before last user can't claim their vested token.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `deployVestingContract()` of `VestingEscrowFactory.sol` contract is very crucial, users will call this function to start vesting. The Rio-Vesting system was designed in such a way that one organisation can deploy their factory contract and using that factory user can start vesting. The issue here is the `claim()` only allow the last user who have vested to claim tokens, all users before the last user is unable to claim, the `claim()` will simply revert for them.
To run the test comment out [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/test/lib/TestUtil.sol#L71) and [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/test/lib/TestUtil.sol#L85) line of `TestUtil.sol` contract.

```
The result:
```solidity
[PASS] test_multipleVesting1() (gas: 783697)
Logs:
  Before claiming the benificiary's balance: 0
  After claiming the benificiary's balance: 1000000000000000000

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 2.00ms
```
In this test we can how user1 and user2 was not able to claim their vested token after the end of the vesting but the last user i.e user3 successfully withdrawn his claim.
## Impact
Users is not able to claim their token.

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Keep the record of all vesting position with recipient, it can be done with mapping. Modify the claim() according to it.
