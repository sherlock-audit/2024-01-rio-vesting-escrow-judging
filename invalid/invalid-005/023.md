# `VestingEscrow` cannot work properly with multiple addresses token

## Summary

Should the `token()` within the `VestingEscrow` involve multiple addresses, it becomes possible for anyone to transfer all remaining tokens, including the `locked()` and `unclaimed()` ones, to the designated `recipient()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`recoverERC20` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/2d14c2b84b69c53a45c81aa4f907af9617f9a94f/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L202-L212) exclusively transfers the surplus `token()` within the contract, ensuring sufficient `token()` remains for both `locked()` and `unclaimed()` tokens.

However, there exists a [token with multiple addresses](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#multiple-token-addresses), enabling the transfer of the same token with different addresses. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing a distinct address to circumvent the checks and transfer all tokens to the `recipient()`.

```solidity
    function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;
//@audit if token() is multiple addresses, anyone could transfer all the token() to the recipient()
        if (token_ == address(token())) {
            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
        }
        if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

The `locked()` and `unclaimed()` token in the `VestingEscrow` could be transferred to the `recipient()` incorrectly, causing the entire contract to not work properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to add a check in function `recoverERC20` to make sure that the `token().bakanceOf(this)` after transferring is equal to or greater than the `locked() + unclaimed()`.
