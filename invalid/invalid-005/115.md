# `recoverERC20` method does not correctly handled Proxied Tokens

## Summary

Proxied tokens can have multiple token addresses. `recoverERC20` does not properly handle this case. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at this link: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20 

Here is a screenshot from there:

In this case, our `recoverERC20` function does not correctly handle tokens with multiple addresses due to proxies. Here is what `recoverERC20` looks like:

```solidity
    function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;
        if (token_ == address(token())) {
            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) -
                (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
        }
        if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }
```

Because we allow withdrawing any token and token amount arbitrarily if it is not the provided vesting token, the attacker can simply use the other address for the proxied token, besides the one that is specified in the contract, and withdraw all the funds, even locked ones. 

## Impact

Drainage of funds in the contract, even locked ones.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either disallow withdrawal of any tokens that are not the vesting token or allow admin to specify a blacklist of tokens that can't be withdrawn.
