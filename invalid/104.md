# token regeneration leading to system overload

## Summary

Sending a transaction through the function VestingEscrowFactory.sol#recoverERC20, which can be repeated in a loop.

## Vulnerability Detail

[VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L80-L85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/2d14c2b84b69c53a45c81aa4f907af9617f9a94f/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrowFactory.sol#L80-L85)

```solidity
    function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(owner(), amount);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, amount);
        }
    }
```

An attacker could initiate a transaction and repeatedly execute it in a loop, also leading to the mass generation of `ERC20Recovered` events. If the backend processes these events and performs resource-intensive operations, there is a risk of system overload and temporary service disruption.

## Impact

System overload and temporary service disruption.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit the amount of recoverable tokens within a specific time frame or for any number of transactions.
