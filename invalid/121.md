# Problems with voting transfers across the codebase, leading to incorrect allocation of voting power

## Summary

Voting transfers are incorrect in multiple places across the codebase. 

## Vulnerability Detail

I believe there is a misunderstanding of how the OpenZeppelin `Votes` library is meant to be used, that manifests in multiple places across the codebase. 

First, note that in `VestingEscrowFactory`, we do: `IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, escrow, amount);`, but we actually never transfer the voting power to the escrow contract with `_transferVotingUnits`. Let's say that the admins do this correctly off-chain. 

Then, in multiple places in the contract where there are transfers, the voting powers are never actually updated:

1. When the contracts locked amount is revoked or everything is fully revoked, some token is transferred back to the admin. In this case, the voting power should also be transferred back to the admin with some use of `_transferVotingUnits`, but currently it stays with the user and whoever they specified as the delegate. 
2.  When the user is transferred token when they `claim`, the voting power is not actually transferred to them. This is not as bad because the user can choose who to delegate all the voting power to, so they still have control over the power. 

## Impact

Voting allocations are incorrect in multiple places

## Recommendation
Make sure that voting power is transferred when the token is transferred
