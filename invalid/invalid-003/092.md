# The error logical operator && for the condition exist at _checkOwnerOrManager

## Summary
_checkOwnerOrManager have a error logical operator &&, this cause _checkOwnerOrManager check invalid and don't revoke Unvested. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The _checkOwnerOrManager function appears to have a logical error in its conditional statement. The use of the logical AND (&&) operator suggests that the function will only revert if msg.sender is not equal to both _owner() and _manager() simultaneously. However, considering that an address cannot be both the owner and the manager at the same time, this logical condition will always evaluate to false.
