# Suboptimal usage of the `amount` parameter in the `claim` method

## Summary
The [`claim` method in `VestingEscrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L136C45-L136C46) has a parameter `amount` that defines the amount of vested tokens to withdraw. The way the parameter is handled in the method body has the potential to cause issues with external protocol integrations.

## Vulnerability Detail
At first glance, the `amount` parameter seems to define the fixed amount of tokens the caller of the `claim` method wishes to withdraw. 
However, internally the method's first action is to take the minimum of the available, vested tokens and the `amount` parameter:
```sol
uint256 claimable = Math.min(unclaimed(), amount);
```

The method will then transfer `claimable` to the `recipient`. 

This behaviour, while not a bug per-se, is prone to cause issues with external integrations. In case the `recipient` is another smart contract relying on `claim` transferring `amount` or `revert`ing can lead to it receiving a smaller amount than expected without realizing it. 

The documentation does not mention this behaviour. The return value, which is the amount that has actually been withdrawn, is not documented, and the comment regarding `amount` leaves the false impression that `amount` will in fact be transferred: 
```solidity
/// @param amount Amount of tokens to claim.
```

Overall, this is a suboptimal design for the method that should be avoided.

## Impact
Potential for loss of funds in external integrations.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 /// @notice Claim tokens which have vested.
/// @param beneficiary Address to transfer claimed tokens to.
/// @param amount Amount of tokens to claim.
function claim(address beneficiary, uint256 amount) external onlyRecipient returns (uint256) {
  uint256 claimable = Math.min(unclaimed(), amount);
  totalClaimed += claimable;

  token().safeTransfer(beneficiary, claimable);
  emit Claim(beneficiary, claimable);

  return claimable;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either:
- clearly document this behaviour in the natspec, including the `@return` value, oro
- recommended: `require(amount <= unclaimed(), "Not enough tokens available")`
