# totalLocked value can be released immediately after creation

## Summary
In the `deployVestingContract` function from the VestingEscrowFactory contract, we see that less attention was paid to the vestingStart which allows a user to be able to unlock the entire tokens vested almost immediately after creation if a mistake was made while calling the function. The `deployVestingContract` can be called by anyone in or outside the Rio organization, so this mistake is highly likely to happen

## Vulnerability Detail
If the `vestingStart` parameter was less than the `block.timestamp`, say 100 or 100000, and the `vestingDuration` is roughly a day, let's say 100000, this means we have endTime as 100100 in scenario 1 and 200000 in scenario 2 during deployment of the VestingEscrow contract.

The recipient can then call the `claim` function with max Value of the tokens locked, the claim function checks for claimable tokens using the `unclaimed` function .

In the `unclaimed` function the `claimTime` is now, and `totalClaimed` is zero. The `_totalVestedAt` function is called with the `claimTime`.

The math checks `_totalLocked * (claimTime - startTime) / (endTime - startTime).`

In scenario 1, this gives ` _totalLocked * (claimTime / 100100)`, using the `block.timestamp` of right now, the `claimTime` is 1705146362, so `_totalVestedAt` returns a minimum of `_totalLocked` and approx `17000 * _totalLocked`, which is `_totalLocked`, allowing the recipient to claim entire tokens almost immediately.

In scenario 2, it is a minimum of `_totalLocked` and approx `9000 * _totalLocked`, which still causes the same issue

## Impact
This invalidates the true purpose of the smart contract and could cause the users to lose trust in the protocol as the vesting features do not work in some cases

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to force `vestingStart` to be at least `block.timestamp`
