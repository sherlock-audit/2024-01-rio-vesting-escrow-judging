# The whole escrow balance can be withdrawn prematurely if used with double entry point tokens

## Summary
If the vesting is used with double entry point tokens, which is an edge case, but still realistic [especially that it already happened on Compound](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-tusd-integration-issue-retrospective), the vesting funds can be withdrawn immediately using the second entry point of a token, by the recipient, disregarding the lock time.

## Vulnerability Detail
It may happen that a token such as  [weird ERC20 - multi entry point](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#multiple-token-addresses) is used with the `VestingEscrow` - it can have a double entry point, which means, there are two addresses that allows for interaction with the token, while the escrow restrict just one address from being recovered in function [recoverERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L202)
As per the contest description, the protocol is to be used with any tokens, with the exception of rebasing tokens and tokens that charge a fee on transfer. Therefore a valid scenario should include presence of such tokens too.


## Impact
The funds can be withdrawn by the recipient prematurely in full, draining the escrow and neglecting the vesting escrow logic completely.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

    function recoverERC20(address token_, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 recoverable = amount;
        if (token_ == address(token())) { //@audit double entry point tokens might be recovered early via second address
            uint256 available = token().balanceOf(address(this)) - (locked() + unclaimed());
            recoverable = Math.min(recoverable, available);
        }
        if (recoverable > 0) {
            IERC20(token_).safeTransfer(recipient(), recoverable);
            emit ERC20Recovered(token_, recoverable);
        }
    }

```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either introduce an array of addresses for the `token()` allowing adding multiple addresses which are associated with it, or accept the risk and explicitly warn users that this contract is not compatible with such tokens.
