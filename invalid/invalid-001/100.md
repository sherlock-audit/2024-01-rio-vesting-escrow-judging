# Unlimited Voting Access for OZ Governance Contracts

## Summary
Anyone can vote on OZ Governance Contract Proposals related to the Vested Token due to incorrect access control in OZVotingAdaptor.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
Given there is a proposal a malicious or unauthorized party wishes to participate in. If they attempted to interact with VestingEscrow.sol, they would be unable to due to the onlyRecipient modifier in the vote() and voteWithReason() functions. However they could interface directly with the _votingAdaptor() implementation address and vote as many times as they please.

OZ Governor functions only as a governance tool and doesn't verify if they msg.sender is supposed to be able to cast a vote, but they do note who the msg.sender is. Thus it is insufficient as a means of authorization or access control.

## Impact
Governance related for any Vested Token can be manipulated leading to unexpected behavior and results depending on the proposal in question.
