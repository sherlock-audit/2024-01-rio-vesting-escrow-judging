# VotingEscrow::Unexpected behaviour in voting power

## Summary
An user can delegate more than 1 delegatee and increase the voting power each of them, this increment is malicious because the total voting power will be far more than that user's locked amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
The system allows a user to delegate more than 1 delegatee. That user can partially claim his amount and use those amount to fund the escrow contract and delegate a new delegatee as many times as he wants until his token balance becomes 0. We can see it in test case. To conduct the test we will have to modify the [`TestUtil.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/test/lib/TestUtil.sol) file, just comment out [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/test/lib/TestUtil.sol#L71) and [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/test/lib/TestUtil.sol#L85) line, make a test file inside **test** folder and paste this test case:

  address owner = vm.addr(1);

  address user1 = vm.addr(3);
  address delegatee = vm.addr(9);
  address delegatee2 = vm.addr(10);

    deployVestingEscrow(VestingEscrowConfig(3 ether, user1, 10 days, uint40(block.timestamp), 5 days, true, ''));
    vm.warp(10 days + block.timestamp);

    // Claiming 2 ether, so 1 ether will be used to provide voting power to delegatee
    deployedVesting.claim(user1, 2 ether);
    console.log("after claiming user1's balance:", token.balanceOf(user1));
    console.log("balance of escrow contract after 1st claim:", token.balanceOf(address(deployedVesting)));

    // Delegated delegatee
    deployedVesting.delegate(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeDelegateCallData(delegatee));
    console.log("Delegated first time");
    console.log("voting power of delegatee:", token.getVotes(delegatee));

    //transfering 1 ether to escrow contract as the escrow contract funds the delegatee
    token.transfer(address(deployedVesting), 1 ether);
    console.log("after transfering to escrow contract the balance of the user1 is:", token.balanceOf(user1));
    console.log("balance of escrow contract after 1st transfer:", token.balanceOf(address(deployedVesting)));

    // escrow contract successfully funded the delegatee2 
    deployedVesting.delegate(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeDelegateCallData(delegatee2));
    console.log("after delegating 2nd time the balance of the user1 is:", token.balanceOf(user1));
    console.log("voting power of delegatee2:", token.getVotes(delegatee2));
    console.log("delegated 2nd time");

    // again transfering 1 ether to escrow contract, purpose is same, funding the escrow contract so that it can fund delegatee3
    token.transfer(address(deployedVesting), 1 ether);
    console.log("after transfering again to escrow contract the balance of the user1 is:", token.balanceOf(user1));
    console.log("balance of escrow contract after 1st transfer:", token.balanceOf(address(deployedVesting)));

    // escrow contract successfully funded delegatee3
    deployedVesting.delegate(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeDelegateCallData(delegatee3));
    console.log("voting power of delegatee3:", token.getVotes(delegatee3));
    console.log("Delegated 3rd time");

  }
}
```
The result is:
```solidity

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 2.67ms
```
Here we can clearly see that total voting power provided by user1 is `(1000000000000000000+2000000000000000000+3000000000000000000) = 6000000000000000000` i.e 6 ether but he vested only 3 ether. 
## Impact
An user can maliciously delegate multiple delegatee and increase total voting power far more than his locked amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Add some logic which implements a restriction on multiple delegation.
