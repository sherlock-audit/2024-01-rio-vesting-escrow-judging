# Attacker can front-run `deployVestingContract` to deploy at the same address

## Summary
Vesting contract is deployed by using `LibClone#clone()` function, which is using `CREATE1`. An attacker can front-run deployVault to deploy at the same address, but with different config. If the deployed chain reorg, a different vault might also be deployed at the same address.

## Vulnerability Detail
`LibClone#clone()` function use `CREATE1` to create address:

            instance := create(0, sub(data, 0x4c), add(extraLength, 0x6c))
And `initialize()` function in the vesting escrow does not forbidden for the factory to be called again. So the attacker can front-running function `deployVestingContract()`, deploy another vault with different config, and end up with token of the victim will be transfered to attacker's vault

## Impact
Attacker will steal token that victim's vault should have

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Using `cloneDeterministic` in the `LibClone` contract and combine `msg.sender` in the salt
