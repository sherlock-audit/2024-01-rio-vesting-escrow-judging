## Summary
If isFullyRevokable = false and the recipient can't claim the unclaimed vesting, the owner has no way to rescue this fund

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no function to recover these unclaimed funds

## Impact
Lost of funds for the recipient

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/main/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L177

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a function:
 `recoverUnclaimed(address beneficiary, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner`

with the cooldown of 14 days after the vesting end and only owner can call this function. So that the owner can rescue the fund without confusing the recipient
