# User Will Not Be Able To Claim Reward

## Summary
The `unClaimed` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-rio-vesting-escrow/blob/2d14c2b84b69c53a45c81aa4f907af9617f9a94f/rio-vesting-escrow/src/VestingEscrow.sol#L119) has an issue. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `unClaimed` function returns the amount of unClaimed or vested tokens for recipient to claim as this calculations  is used :
```solidity
 return _totalVestedAt(claimTime) - totalClaimed; // @audit undflows due to totalVested < totalClaimed?
```
The issue here is that whenever the `totalClaimed` is > the amount of token getting vested at a particular time (`_totalVestedAt()`) the function will revert and no recipient will be able to claim reward again. The totalClaimed is getting incremented whenever a user claims, so there definitely will be a situation where its more than the token getting vested at a particular time. The `unClaimed` function is getting called whenever user is to claim his reward like : 
```solidity
 uint256 claimable = Math.min(unclaimed(), amount);
        totalClaimed += claimable;
```

Consider this scenario : 

1. Alice and bob  decided to claim their token each after vesting
2. Alice decided to go first and claim lets say `100e18` after  100 days
3. Bob followed and claimed 20e18 after 200 days
4. Now total claimed is `120e18`
5. An innocent user decided to claim lets say 5e18 of  his reward after that , and he'll be subjected to the same calculations of  `_totalVested`  (lets say 5e18) - `totalClaimed` (120e18)
6. This will revert due to underflow and user will not be able to claim his reward

Here is a `test` showing the underflow  due to `totalClaimed` > `_totalVestedAt`
```solidity
    address bob = makeAddr('musa');
    address alice = makeAddr('alice');
    address innoccentUser = makeAddr('innocent');

    function testClaims() external {
        vm.warp(100 days);

        // claim when timestamp is at 100 days ^
        deployedVesting.claim(alice, 1e18);

        // claim when timestamp is at 200 days ^
        vm.warp(200 days);
        deployedVesting.claim(bob, 1e18);

        // claim when timestamp is at 150 days  and when totalClaimed is > _vestedAt thus underflow
        vm.warp(150 days);
        deployedVesting.claim(innoccentUser, 1e18);

        // deployedVesting.unclaimed();

        deployedVesting._totalVestedAt(100 days);

        deployedVesting.totalClaimed();
        deployedVesting.disabledAt();

        // vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact
User will not be able to claim his reward

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

consider adding a check to ensure it never revert, like checking whether the `_totalVestedAt` is more than `totalClaimed` before making that calculations that causes the revert, this will be something like : 
```solidity
function unclaimed() public view returns (uint256) {
    if (isFullyRevoked) return 0;

    uint256 claimTime = Math.min(block.timestamp, disabledAt);
    uint256 totalVested = _totalVestedAt(claimTime);

    // Check for underflow before subtracting
    if (totalVested >= totalClaimed) {
        return totalVested - totalClaimed;
    } else {
        return 0;  // Prevent underflow, return 0 if totalVested is less than totalClaimed
    }
}
```
