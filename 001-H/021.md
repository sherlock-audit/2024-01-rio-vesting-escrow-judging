# Destructing VestingEscrow implementation via delegatecall

## Summary

Implementation contract can be destructed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can call delegate (or vote/voteWithReason) on VestingEscrow implementation contract and delegate to the contract with selfdestruct opcode because voting adapter (delegate to) and recipient (access control) addresses extracted from attacker controlled calldata.

NOTE: in lido implementation these addresses are stored in proxy storage, but here they are taken from user controlled calldata which opens up doors for this attack.

## Impact

Malicious user can destruct VestingEscrow contract and DoS all vestings.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow only delegate calls to implementation by safe guarding all functions with this modifier
```solidity
address private immutable self = address(this);
modifier onlyDelegateCall() {
    require(address(this) != self);
    _;
}
```
