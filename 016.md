# Adaptor heavily relies on single-step ownership transfer pattern is dangerous

## Summary
The `OZVotingAdapter` is the Middleware for voting with tokens under vesting. It implements `Ownable` access control ownership. This allows an account that is the owner of a contract to solely perform administrative tasks on it. Furthermore, it was inconsistent with `VestinEscrowFactory` that utilized Ownable2Step.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inheriting from OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract means you are using a single-step ownership transfer pattern. If an admin provides an incorrect address the next time for the new owner this will result in none of the `onlyOwner` marked methods being callable again. Since we know that `OZVotingAdaptor` is a vital middleware, we must use the 2-step FA method.

## Impact
The intention was to use 2 Step Authenticator on both `VestingEscrow` and `VestingEscrowFactory`a crucial middleware contract, but the ownership can be directed to the wrong accounts leading to loss of tokens and ether.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `Ownable2Step` two-step ownership transfer approach, where the new owner should first claim its new rights before they are transferred.
