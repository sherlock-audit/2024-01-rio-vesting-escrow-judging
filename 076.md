# Possibility of Arithamatic Overflow or Underflow

## Summary
In `OZVotingAdaptor` contract  function `encodeVoteCallData`  use a parameter `support`  which is `uint8` which can cause overflow or underflow and cause the functions to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `OZVotingAdaptor` contract  If the support parameter overflows in the `encodeVoteCallData` function, it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential contract failure. In Solidity versions 0.8 and above, arithmetic overflow or underflow results in a revert, preventing the contract state from being modified. Specifically, in this context, the support parameter is expected to be of type uint8, which has a maximum value of 255. If the support value exceeds this limit, the transaction will revert, indicating an overflow error.
## Impact
Unintended Reverts and Inconsistent State:

```solidity
    function encodeVoteCallData(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support) external pure returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encode(proposalId, support);
    }  
```

## POC

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

import {OZVotingAdaptorTest} from "./OZVotingAdaptor.t.sol";
import {IGovernor} from '@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/IGovernor.sol';
import {TestUtil} from 'test/lib/TestUtil.sol';

contract OverflowTest is OZVotingAdaptorTest {

    function testSupportOverflow() public {
        // Trigger the overflow by passing a value that's too large for uint8
        bytes memory params = abi.encode(10, 256);
        ozVotingAdaptor.vote(params);

        // Check for revert using a try/catch block
        try IGovernor(ozVotingAdaptor.governor()).castVote(1, 2) {} catch {
            require(false, "Expected revert did not occur");
        }
    }
}

here we can clearly see that EVM is reverting the transaction due to overflow


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this potential issue, it's advisable to add a check to ensure that the `support` value does not exceed the expected range. This can be done by adding a require statement before encoding the data, as shown below:

```solidity
require(support <= type(uint8).max, "Support value exceeds uint8 range");
```
This check ensures that the `support` value is within the valid range for a `uint8`, preventing overflow issues. The same check can be applied in the `vote` function or any other functions where the `support` parameter is used.
